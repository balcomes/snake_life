You are a snake with a barren womb.  You must suffer the indignity of playing caretaker for your addled ward, Derpy.  Consume apples before they rot and spread fungus spores for Derpy to stumble upon.  Be careful!  These spores are poisonous to you.  But good enough for Derpy.  Derpy doesn't deserve better.  Derpy deserves to eat detritus.

Grow Derpy, Grow...  Tangle up.  Suffer a rat king's fate.  Let your children burst forth from you in a cloud of miasma and gore.  I will coil myself around the fate of your progeny.  Carving its miserable, deficient existence.

Let these surrogates be my paltry contribution to my kind.
